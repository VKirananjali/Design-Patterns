# Design-Patterns
Design Patterns in Practice —  collection of commonly used Creational, Structural, and Behavioral design patterns implemented with clear, practical code examples.

## Purpose
This repository demonstrates how to implement classic GoF design patterns with real-world examples. It’s a helpful reference for developers who want to understand, apply, and master design patterns in modern software development.

## Included Patterns
### Creational Patterns
Singleton — Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global access point.
Factory Method — Create objects without specifying the exact class.
Prototype — Clone existing objects instead of creating new ones from scratch.
Builder — Construct complex objects step by step.
Registry — Centralized place to store and retrieve shared objects.

### Structural Patterns
Adapter — Allow incompatible interfaces to work together.

### Behavioral Patterns
Observer — Define a one-to-many dependency so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.
Strategy — Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repo: git clone https://github.com/VKirananjali/Design-Patterns.git
2. Navigate to the pattern you want to explore.
3. Run the examples and study the code comments.
4. Try modifying or extending the patterns to see how they work!

## Why Use Design Patterns?
Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. They:
Improve code reusability and readability
Make systems easier to maintain and scale
Help teams speak a common design language

## Contributions
Pull requests are welcome! If you’d like to add examples in other languages, improve explanations, or contribute new patterns — feel free to fork and open a PR.
